And like that one thing came up and they were like, “You lied to us. You are banned.” And I'm like, I didn't do anything super wrong. Like I didn't need, you know, get convicted or anything like that... I was checking my bank account and notice, like a payment from care.com. And I was like, oh, like I know that the families can pay through the platform. So that's probably what it looks like. So I like logged in trying to figure out what this payment came from is like this big like, pop up that said, like, you did not pass your background check. But I'd already been working for two different families for a month at this point, when they decided they didn't pass my background check, and told those two families that I had passed. So it took them a month to like, find this one small thing that I did.","entry":"2","speaker":"P4","insight":"insight relating this quote to our defined goals"},{"broker":"platform","topic":"surveillance","quote":"I kind of just look for like, sort of compatible styles. You know, how, like, autonomous, I'll be able to be like, I don't want to be like, micromanaged too much. I had one family that was like, you know, we expect her nanny to text us every 30 minutes with an update. And I was like, I can't do that...it got to the point where I was there for two months. And it was just like, nothing relented, you know, they've just still wanted the same, like, just constant updates, like constant like, like documentation of like, what we were doing and stuff... I just I feel like there's just not that much trust, I guess. And it also made my job a lot harder.","entry":"1","speaker":"P2","insight":"insight relating this quote to our defined goals"},{"broker":"platform","topic":"surveillance","quote":"I nannied for this one family in [US State], one summer and. And they had me on camera, like the whole time it felt like. And I, we I never—  I was never sure if it was on or not. But it was in the living room. Like it wasn't at the door. It was in the living room. And so I didn't notice it until like, a weekend or something. Because I thought I saw it blink or I thought— I was like, is that thing on? And is that for me? Or for the kids? Or you know, and I feel I think I thought it was so awkward. And I just felt kind of powerless and didn't, didn't bring it up....but also like, I need some cash. So I'm just going to really watch myself in front of this camera, but I don't know if it's on or not.","entry":"2","speaker":"P12","insight":"insight relating this quote to our defined goals"},{"broker":"platform","topic":"surveillance","quote":"The other thing with Care is, it's so hard to get bad reviews taken down, which is totally understandable. But sometimes you will have a conversation with a person through the messaging app on Care, and then decide it's not for you. And they'll go and write a bad review about you even though you've never worked for them….Yeah, and then you can't get taken down. So then you have to delete your profile and start all over again. So I just wanted to avoid all of that at all costs. So I'm always super diligent about like tying up loose ends on Care and making sure like, no one's gonna go back and write a bad review about me, because that's, that's detrimental to a nanny, because this is all people have to go off of.","entry":"3","speaker":"P5","insight":"insight relating this quote to our defined goals"},{"broker":"platform","topic":"hacking","quote":"So because you not a have a contract, you know, like nothing, just only like oh “work to work.” But now with that group that- that I mentioned that we have, like, we have, like Hola Nannies community, we have another group, Babies Sitters Latinas, so we share our experience about it. And now, a lot of nannies, we ask for the contract, at least like, you know, with something, we have to write it down and sign it... I call them, it’s not a contract, it's an agreement. You know, like, okay, but before now, before it was like, I got the interview, I got the job. And sometimes they don't pay me when I'm sick. And I was shy to ask for that... I really like a scared, you know... maybe they quit me- like if I'm not a- if I asked for my sick days, or my vacations and yeah. So but now like, now I have an agreement with the people that when I had the job, like 'Okay, look, that's- this is what I want. And let's, let's write down everything we can sign it...' I know some nannies that don't do that.","entry":"1","speaker":"P14","insight":"insight relating this quote to our defined goals"},{"broker":"platform","topic":"hacking","quote":"[Looking at her profile picture on a care work platform] I was thinking that I look happy... I looked pretty. I look approachable. I tend to be extremely, like uh, [pause] docile in interviews and like, I, I hate that I default to like, you know, “I'll do anything”. Like it would be my honor to do—  to work with you, or for you or whatever. Um, I look really young in that photo. I mean, I was young, then, I should really if I like I was using this. I should have updated this probably.. Um.. Yeah, and I think that there's definitely, people… [pause] yeah. [pause] Yeah. I don't know. It's, it's gross that people are like scanning what people look like in choosing their, their nanny. … So, oh, [she highlights pieces of text from her profile as she explains] you can see I'm trying to put up close that I have a master's degree. To try to be like I'm, you know, acknowledging that our society might value me more if I have that, or whatever, even though if there's no jobs in my field at all. Um [chuckles] and I just tried to say I have a ton of childcare experience. I tried to give examples of like, all of the all the fun and different places I've worked, and like settings with kids to try to cast a wide net.","entry":"2","speaker":"P12","insight":"insight relating this quote to our defined goals"},{"broker":"care co-op","topic":"digitaldivide","quote":"To be honest, that the, the [co-op] recruitment process is quite like, like, having taken part in it, it was… one of the hardest recruitment processes I've been through. Because normally, when you work for companies, and they're so desperate for people that they make it really easy. So you know, they genuinely… the application form is pretty small and sparse. And they just invite you in and you talk to a couple of people and they give you the job on the spot. That's normally how it works. Whereas with [co-op], yet, you've got to do creative writing, really, you've got to be able to tell stories. You've got, you've got to be able to tell stories of previous experiences. And I suppose what they're looking for is people with similar values. So there's that. But, and then, when you go for interview, there's a panel of three which feels quite nerve wracking. But they do give you the questions beforehand, so you know what you're going to be asked, so you have a chance to rehearse it.","entry":"1","speaker":"P11","insight":"insight relating this quote to our defined goals"},{"broker":"platform","topic":"digitaldivide","quote":"So, for me, it was easy. Yeah, for me, it was easy, because I know how to use the computer. But some people that- I have a friend that they cannot- they don't know how to use it. Sometimes I have to help them to create a profile. It's easy, but for some people, they're not, you know, and yeah, it was easy. (Interviewer: 'What do they have challenges with?') That is because you have to send the resume. And some people, they don't know how to do the resume. So it's one of the challenges. And you have to even if you have more, like better presentation, like you know, like take a picture of your profile how they look. So and- some people just didn't know how to do that. So it's been a challenge for the people that they don't know how to do their resume, or how to use a computer, then.","entry":"2","speaker":"P14","insight":"insight relating this quote to our defined goals"},{"broker":"care co-op","topic":"posexperiences","quote":"It makes you feel a bit more important and a bit more like you've got a voice, whereas, you know, in the traditional agency I was with before, and I was going to quite a few calls where I was being abused, and I was being hit and my hair pulled and, you know, I was reporting all this, and it was a case of “there's nobody else”. So you go in. And many a time I've been in not very nice situations where I've come away, upset or dreading going the day after, and like almost like a safeguarding issue, and that would never happen here. Because I know I've got the voice and, and I'll be listened to and yeah, it's it's so different.

Like one of them was experiencing a lot of just emotional, just challenges of being, you know, nine, but... and so we had a lot of fights. And it was like really dramatic a lot of the time but I don't know the family just had a really honest relationship. And we sort of navigated those issues together. And I was there every day. And they always had a pot of coffee ready like when I got there and, um, it was just, I don't know, I just felt like I was part of their family for a little while in a way that most other nannying jobs I have not really felt that way.","entry":"2","speaker":"P12","insight":"insight relating this quote to our defined goals"}],"whys":[{"topic":"onboarding","why":"During onboarding, care workers begin their relationship with a broker. This sometimes involves training, a formal hiring process, background checks, or registration on an app. We found that care workers may be rejected from a broker (by having their background check flagged, for example) during this phase. Workers reported (and we confirmed) that people who register for Care.com can have their account disabled unexpectedly, with no explanation. Once their work is mediated by a broker, care workers are still bound by its rules and expectations."},{"topic":"surveillance","why":"Care brokers use, and often encourage clients to use surveillance technologies. Generally, Care Brokers work to negate any liability involving the care relationships they facilitate. To this end, Brokers encourage clients to use cameras, implement background checks, and monitor their care worker’s social media accounts regularly. Furthermore, Care Brokers monitor messages between care workers and clients on platforms to support narratives about their services. Most care platforms implement algorithms that reduce the visibility of care worker profiles if care workers don’t respond to client messages within a given time frame, usually 24 hours. The use of technologies in this way not only enforces a care narrative solely constructed by the brokers, but also has real impacts on the quality of caring relationships and the well-being of care workers."},{"topic":"hacking","why":"Care workers often find workarounds to common problems created by brokers. These “hacks” improve their chances of success in a system that seems set up for failure. Sometimes, this involves making daily, personal decisions about how they present themselves in the platform (such as appealing to beauty standards) to increase engagement with their online profiles. In other cases, hacks are collective and counter the daily reality of isolation that characterizes their work (especially on platforms). Care workers find answers to common problems, find jobs, vent, and share resources on social media — including template contracts for platform workers. Contracts are sometimes shared by prospective clients, but can also be initiated by care workers. Although they can be a source of protection, it is unclear how far those protections extend."},{"topic":"digitaldivide","why":"Every broker we studied puts up barriers to finding and keeping a job. Brokers also maintain racialized hierarchies in who gets to hire care workers, and who is doing the caring. We found that language and technical skills are bound up in these hierarchies. For example, some platforms are only available in English. The care co-operative, which claims to share power among care workers and clients, requires a lengthy interview process featuring creative writing in English. Reflecting the racialized history of care work, the workers we spoke to discussed how the majority of people seeking care on platforms like Care.com are white and fairly wealthy, since they can pay for the services they need out of pocket. Sadly, the same was true for the care co-operative. In one care worker’s experience, only state-funded agencies act as care brokers for poor and working class clients, and these featured the worst working conditions for carers."},{"topic":"posexperiences","why":"Care co-operative workers reported several positive experiences at work, due to their ability to resolve conflicts through conversations aided by a facilitator/advocate, high rates of pay, and ability to participate and lead trainings. For platform workers, such stories were rare, but still possible. In these situations, across brokers, carers reported feeling that there was a trusting relationship with the client or family, as well as a sense of belonging, purpose, and appreciation."}]}},"pageContext":{}},
